## Project Scenario
```
A startup company has decided to build their own micro-blogging platform and has hired you to be its first cloud engineer.
The company paid a web-development firm to translate their wireframe designs into a mock web-application for the purpose of demoing to raise capital.
After a successful round of funding, you [the cloud engineer] have been tasked with taking the mock web-application and making it production ready at scale.
The startup company consulted a fractional CTO to help choose some of the technical requirements to place the company on a good technical roadmap:

âœ… The frontend application should be written in Javascript using React (functional components).
âœ… The backend application should be written in Python using Flask
âœ… Since we plan to be API only
âœ… Since we want to choose a popular framework API only framework
âœ… Since we want a micro-framework because we are offloading as much to the cloud as possible to avoid be a monolithic application
âœ… Since we donâ€™t want an ORM because the CTO considers it an anti-pattern
âœ… Since Python is the most popular language being learned for cloud right now
âœ… That an API specification be defined detailing the exact endpoints required.

The web application:
âœ… Shall be deployed to AWS.
âœ… Takes advantage of modern-applications cloud services.
âœ… Ensure to keep the cloud provider costs as low as possible
