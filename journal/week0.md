## Homework Challenges

âœ… [[Installed AWS CLI Latest version]((https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)) on GitPod Desktop with [env variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)]
   ```
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
   unzip awscliv2.zip
   sudo ./aws/install
   ```

   Updated my .gitpod.yml
   ```
   tasks:
    - name: aws-cli
      env:
         AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
      init:
         cd /workspace
         curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
         unzip awscliv2.zip
         sudo ./aws/install
         cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT

   vscode:
     extensions:
       - 42Crunch.vscode-openapi
   ```
   
   Set Env Vars
   ```
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=""
  ```
  
  To check env vars
  ```
  env | grep AWS_
  ```
  
  We will tell gitpod to remember these credentials if we relaunch our credentials
  ```
  gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
  gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
  gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=""
  ```
  Check that AWS cli is working or not:
  ```
  aws sts get-caller-identity
  ```
  Output
  ```
  {
    "UserId": "",
    "Account": "",
    "Arn": ""
  }
  ```
