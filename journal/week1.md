# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Technical Tasks
```
ðŸ‘‰ Create a new GitHub repo
ðŸ‘‰ Launch the repo within a Gitpod workspace
ðŸ‘‰ Configure Gitpod.yml configuration, eg. VSCode Extensions
ðŸ‘‰ Clone the frontend and backend repo
ðŸ‘‰ Explore the codebases
ðŸ‘‰ Ensure we can get the apps running locally
ðŸ‘‰ Write a Dockerfile for each app
ðŸ‘‰ Ensure we get the apps running via individual container
ðŸ‘‰ Create a docker-compose file
ðŸ‘‰ Ensure we can orchestrate multiple containers to run side by side
ðŸ‘‰ Mount directories so we can make changes while we code
```

## Business Scenario
```
Your company has received the code repositories for the demo application from the contracted web-development firm. The company wants you to investigate the codebases, and ensure you can get them running.

The fractional CTO has suggested we first begin containerizing the applications for both developer and production use, and their reasons stayed why:
ðŸ—¹ To avoid lack of documentation of application and OS configuration
ðŸ—¹ To ensure the effort of application and OS configuration is factored in before investing lots of feature development
ðŸ—¹ If we decide to hire our technical team members we can quickly replicate these environments in any preferred choice.

The fractional CTO has asked that everything be developed in Gitpod, (a Cloud Developer Environment). This will allow the CTO at a press of a button launch the developer environment in a clean state to help with any tricky or emergency implementations, and ensure developer accountability.

Gitpod was since it supports multiple Version Control Services (VCS).. The company has invested considerable effort already in Atlassian JIRA working with the web-dev firm, and repoâ€™s highly likely might be moved to Atlassian BitBucket to take advantage of better integrations within the Atlassianâ€™s ecosystem

## Homework Challenges
âœ… Installed Docker extension for vs code
    https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/overview
    
âœ… Created a Dockerfile for backend-flask
   ```
    FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

    # make a new folder inside container
    WORKDIR /backend-flask

    # this contains the libraries want to install to runt the app
    COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
    RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    COPY . .

    ENV FLASK_ENV=development

    EXPOSE ${PORT}
    CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]
  ```
   Run the following commands:
   ```
   cd backend-flask/
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   export FRONTEND_URL="*"
   export BACKEND_URL="*"
   python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
   ```
   
  - make sure to unlock the port on the port tab
  - open the link for 4567 in your browser
  - append to the url to /api/activities/home
  - you should get the json data
  - to make JSON easy to read install JSON Formatter chrome extension
  
  To build Container
  ```
  unset FRONTEND
  unset BACKEND
  cd ..
  docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask
  ```
  To check
  ```
  docker images
  ```
  To run container
  ```
  FRONTEND_URL="*" BACKEND_URL="*" docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask
  docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask
  ```
  To run in background
  ```
  docker container run --rm -p 4567:4567 -d backend-flask
  ```
  To get Container Images or check running Container Ids
  ```
  docker ps
  docker images
  ```
  To check Container Logs
  ```
  docker logs CONTAINER_ID -f
  docker logs backend-flask -f
  ```
  To delete an Image
  ```
  docker image rm backend-flask --force
  ```
  
  âœ… Created a Dockerfile for frontend
  We have to run NPM Install before building the container 
  ```
  cd frontend-react-js
  npm i
  ```
  Create Docker File
  ```
  FROM node:16.18

  ENV PORT=3000

  COPY . /frontend-react-js
  WORKDIR /frontend-react-js
  RUN npm install
  EXPOSE ${PORT}
  CMD ["npm", "start"]
  ```
  To build Container
  ```
  docker build -t frontend-react-js ./frontend-react-js
  ```
  To run container
  ```
  docker run -p 3000:3000 -d frontend-react-js
  ```
  
  âœ… Docker compose
  ```
  Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then,     with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
  ```
  Create docker-compose.yml at the root of your project.
  ```
    version: "3.8"
    services:
      backend-flask:
        environment:
          FRONTEND_URL: "https://3000-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
          BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
        build: ./backend-flask
        ports:
          - "4567:4567"
        volumes:
          - ./backend-flask:/backend-flask
      frontend-react-js:
        environment:
          REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
        build: ./frontend-react-js
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
        volumes:
          - ./frontend-react-js:/frontend-react-js

    # the name flag is a hack to change the default prepend folder
    # name when outputting the image names
    networks: 
      internal-network:
        driver: bridge
        name: cruddur
  ```
  Run docker compose up and the Docker compose command starts and runs your entire app

  # Adding DynamoDB Local and Postgres
  Add following into our existing docker compose file:
  ```
      db:
        image: postgres:13-alpine
        restart: always
        environment:
          - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
          - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
        ports:
          - '5432:5432'
        volumes: 
          - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    volumes:
      db:
        driver: local
  ```
  ```

    user: root
    command: "-jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb -dbPath ./data"

    volumes:
